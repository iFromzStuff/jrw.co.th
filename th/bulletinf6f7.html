						<br>
												The 
							fast changing trend of telecommunication 
							technological development has led to the continued 
							growth of the upstream and downstream industries and 
							pushed the government and private agencies to adjust 
							themselves by making investments to improve and 
							better related infrastructures to serve the uses of 
							the customers and general public.<br>
						<br>
						The continual investment of the telecommunicating 
						servicing offices has been a significant factor of the 
						Company’s operating expansion. The Company on the other 
						hand has changed its main earning businesses from the 
						subcontracting works of the labor intensive tower and 
						OSP cable system installing to designing, supplying, 
						subcontracting, testing and providing consultancy of the 
						total solution of the telecommunicating system which 
						needs specialized skills since 2008. Initially, the 
						Company made joint investment with JRW Network Solutions 
						Co. Ltd. (“Networks”) by holding the 20 per cent share 
						of the paid-up capital. Network has had 
						telecommunicating system designing skills. It was in 
						February 2009 that the Company sold portion of that 
						investment to divert itself fully to the total solution 
						under the telecommunicating solution designing skilled 
						teams. In April 2009, the Company sold the rest 
						investment in Network, changed its business structure 
						and accordingly has increased its operating results 
						since 2008.<br>
						<br>
						The consolidated operating result of the Company during 
						2003 – 2008 comprised of that of the Company and the 
						subsidiary Jaya Soft Vision Co. Ltd. (“Jaya”) as per the 
						shareholding proportion. The operating result of the 
						Company in 2009 however consisted of that for the entire 
						2009 of the Company and that of Jaya Vision for the 
						shareholding period up to 25 June 2009 because of the 
						Company’s sale of the entire ordinary shares in Jaya 
						Vision.<br>
						<br>
						The analyses of the consolidated Financial Statements 
						hence differed. The analysis of the operating results 
						showed those of the years 2007 – 2009 whereas the 
						analysis of the consolidated status showed that of the 
						year 2008 ending 31 December 2008 as per the Financial 
						Statements audited by the certified public auditor.<br>
						<br>
						The consolidated Financial Statements for 2007 – 2009 
						manifested the continued increased sale and services to 
						Bt113 million, Bt459.72 million and Bt878.91 million 
						respectively, up by 127.28 per cent and&nbsp; 91.18 per cent 
						from 2007 and 2008 respectively. The surge in income 
						from sale and services in 2008 resulted from the change 
						of the businesses from subcontracting works, mostly 
						short term for low work value, to telecommunication 
						system designing, supply and installing businesses, 
						which edged up the income from the sale of 
						telecommunication system equipment by Bt192.46 million 
						and the income from service and installing 
						sub-contracting to Bt205.56 million, a part of which 
						came from sale of the telecommunicating system turnkey 
						project and equipment. Most of the increase in the sale 
						and service income for 2009 was from the sale of the 
						telecommunication system turnkey and equipment, up from 
						Bt205.26 million in 2008 to Bt771.72 million in 2008, of 
						which large customer was TOT Plc. The Company installed 
						various equipment to TOT Plc. Such as the installing of 
						Trunk Gateway in the Broadband IP Network Expanding and 
						SPC Phone Exchange System Equipment Installation 
						Project, etc. Even though the equipment sale income 
						dipped from Bt192.46 million in 2008 to Bt66.00 million 
						in 2009 owing to the corporate emphasis on the turnkey 
						works that could lead to the repair and maintenance 
						businesses in the future.<br>
						<br>
						The Company recorded Bt (Bt25.29 million), Bt18.25 
						million and Bt70.64 million in net profit (loss) during 
						2007 – 2009 respectively, which were (22.38 per cent), 
						3.97 per cent and 7.98 per cent of the total income, 
						respectively. The main cause of the net loss in&nbsp; 2007 
						was the higher costs of the materials and equipments 
						following the huge rise in the oil prices in the world 
						markets and the Company could not adjust the work 
						amounts to compensate those increases. The increase in 
						the operating results for 2008 and 2009 was attributable 
						to more work volume and value that included the total 
						solution turnkey works on the back of the expansion of 
						the telecommunication businesses. In those two years the 
						Company could control the costs.<br>
						<br>
						The Company’s assets edged up continually. As at 31 
						December 2007 and 2008, the Company had the assets worth 
						Bt101.26 million and Bt169.09 million respectively. In 
						2008, the Company purchased 10 rais of land in the 
						amount of Bt30 million to build a warehouse that shall 
						serve its business expansion in the future and spent 
						Bt15.60 million to adjust that land. As at 31 December 
						2009, the Company’s assets excluding those of its 
						subsidiary totaled Bt483.02 million, most of which, 
						66.79 per cent, were account receivables.<br>
						<br>
						As at the end of 2009, the Company showed its ratio of 
						liabilities to shareholders’ equity at 1.32 times or up 
						by 230 per cent and 780 per cent from 0.40 times and 
						0.15 times in 2007 and 2008 respectively. The increase 
						came from the Company’s subcontracting and equipment and 
						system installing work volume made for significant 
						customers like TOT Plc. The increased works of the 
						normal businesses plus the subcontracting work volume 
						pushed up the accounts payable and hence the current 
						liabilities in the same direction as the increase in the 
						account receivables and thus the current assets. During 
						2007 – 2008, the corporate policies aimed to make more 
						liabilities conservatively and reached the target of 
						increasing the shareholders’ equity, therefore reducing 
						the ratio of the liabilities to the shareholders’ equity 
						to low level.<br>
						<br>
						The operating results and the financial status in the 
						first three months of 2010 showed only the Financial 
						Statements of the Company only because of the sale of 
						the entire investment in the subsidiary, Jaya Network, 
						in June 2009. Those results exhibited Bt16.20 million in 
						net profit or 8.28 per cent of the entire income thanks 
						to the telecommunication turnkey plus the repair and 
						maintenance services for TOT Plc. And the royal air 
						force, which were the continued works from those of 2009 
						such as the sale and purchase o the Network Planning 
						Tools together with the peripherals, the installation of 
						the Trunk Gateway of the Broadband IP Network Expansion 
						Project, the installation of the Sim Management system, 
						the installation of the communication system of the 
						electrical transport system that is linked with 
						Suvarnabhumi Airport and the airplane passenger 
						transport station&nbsp; in the city and the installation of 
						the exchange system equipment in the LPN area and the 
						sub-contracting of the repair and maintenance of SDH and 
						Microwave parts.<br>
						<br>
						As at 31 
						March 2010, the Company had the total assets at Bt463.44 
						million, most of which comprised of the account 
						receivables and the land, buildings and equipment, 60.16 
						per cent and 19.53 per cent of the total assets singly.&nbsp; 
						As at 31 March 2010, the Company recorded the ratio of 
						liabilities to the shareholders’ equity at 1.06 times, 
						an increase when compared to that of the same period of 
						the earlier year at 0.41 times, but that ratio was 
						acceptable and did not affect the corporate liquidity 
						significantly.
